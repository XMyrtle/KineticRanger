Basic kineticist with some tweaks and using Charisma instead of CON.
Regarding spell casting, they get up to level 4 spells normally and up to 6 if merging.
Spells up to level 4 are from the Ranger class; 5 and 6 are from druid.
Spells above 4 only start showing up at caster level 21.
They can merge with Angels/Lich/Azata. (Azata needs Geo Enchanter installed, as it piggybacks of the "AzataIncorporateSpellbook" from there.)
